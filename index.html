<h1>What is a Divorce Ceremony?</h1>
<p>A divorce ceremony is held to mark the end of a relationship, and the beginning of a new life phase.<br>
Some people choose to hold a 'divorce party' in a local pub, but that might not necessarily suit everyone. A divorce ceremony is an alternative. <br>
The contents of each ceremony are different, because everyone brings their own experience, vision and form of spirituality to it.<br>
As an Interfaith Minister, CC is trained to guide you through the process of discovering what would be the right form for you.<br>

  <h1>Why a Divorce Ceremony?</h1>
  <p>There are many reasons why relationships end.<br> 
  The person with whom you once shared ‘the happiest day of your life’, <br>
  with whom you declared your love for each other in front of the people you hold dear,<br> 
  with whom you built a home and a life,<br> 
  that person might one day no longer be the person you want to spend your everyday life with. <br>
  It has happened to many of us. It is a sad moment when, as a couple, you realize that no longer you want to go continue life together. <br>
  
So, why hold a ceremony around this sadness?</p>
<button class="collapsible1">read further...</button>
<div class="content"><p>Sense of closure is an important reason to hold a divorce or separation ceremony.<br> 
Yes, there is some closure if you were married and the divorce gets granted and you have a piece of paper saying you are now officially divorced. That letter might not meet your emotional needs.<br> 
Ending a long-term relationship comes with a grieving process.<br>
Coming together as a couple for the last time, commemorating and honouring the time you spend together, and then leaving as a person free of the ties to the other can bring that sense of closure.<br>
<br>
A wedding vow is quite a big thing, when speaking a vow you seal your sacred promise between yourself and the person is on the receiving end of that promise.<br>
If you say a vow in a religious ceremony, the vow exists between yourself, the other and the god of your understanding.<br> 
When you are going to walk away from that sacred promise and not take care of that person in sickness and health any longer, you might feel the need for rescinding the vow you made.<br> 
Part of a divorce ceremony can to release each other (or just yourself) of the sacred promise that exists between you.<br>
<br>
Ending a relationship often means you will still see each other after the relationship has ended.<br>
Being in a long-term relationship means your life becomes intertwined with that of the other, on all levels. A separation ceremony can be a place where you create space for the transformation from being committed loving partners to the new roles you will play in each others lives.<br>
<br>
A couple of adults that can likely comprehend why they are splitting up and what the consequences are for their lives.<br>
Many couples have children. For children, hearing that their parents will split up, can cause a lot of negative emotions, anxiety and even feelings of guilt. <br>
Creating a ceremony which includes a ritual or sacred promise that involves your children, can help them to overcome these feelings.<br>
They can leave the ceremony in the knowledge that both their parents still love them and are committed to them.<br>  
<br>
As an Interfaith Minister, CC can help families or individuals choose the appropriate setting and rituals to be part of their separation ceremony. <br>
